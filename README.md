# hcm-field-gate

This repository does not generate artifacts.
It does not publish content.
It does not automate production.
It does not sell anything.

Its only function:
to distinguish between what *may appear*
and what *must remain silent*.

This is not a project list.

Nothing here explains the whole.
Nothing here guides your reading.

You are free to leave.
You are free to stay.

What connects these repositories
is not documented.

If something resonates,
it does so without permission.

This state is intentional.

## What is hcm-field-gate?

hcm-field-gate is a sovereign layer within the HCM structure.
It is non-executive, non-operational, and intentionally non-automated.

It does not sit inside the production pipeline.
It exists *before* it.

---

## Why does this repository exist?

Because any system without a Gate
will eventually collapse into noise.

Because:
Markets do not define value.
Volume does not equal depth.
Visibility is not an automatic right.

This repository exists to preserve:
- rhythm
- coherence
- meaning before exposure

---

## What does it actually do?

- Defines conditions for appearance
- Defines conditions for withholding
- Acknowledges waiting as a valid state
- Recognizes silence as a legitimate decision

It performs no execution.

---

## Relationship to other HCM repositories

hcm-field-gate depends on no other repository.
No repository depends on it technically.

Yet all other repositories operate
with *awareness of its existence*.

This is not a dependency.
This is resonance.

---

## Core principle

Any artifact that did not pass through this Gate
may be technically valid,
but is not authorized to exist.

---

HCM does not rush.
HCM permits.
