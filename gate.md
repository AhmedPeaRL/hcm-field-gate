# Gate Decision Principles

This document contains no rigid rules.
It defines sensitive criteria.

Its purpose:
discernment, not control.
guidance, not suppression.

---

## What is automatically withheld?

- Any artifact that directly explains HCM
- Any artifact seeking validation or attention
- Any artifact repeating what is already obvious
- Any artifact born from pressure or urgency
- Any artifact that adds no real differentiation

Excessive clarity flattens.
Direct explanation breaks resonance.

---

## What is permitted to appear?

- Artifacts that relieve real pressure
- Artifacts that function as tools, not statements
- Artifacts usable without understanding HCM
- Artifacts that do not fully explain themselves
- Artifacts that tolerate silence after release

---

## Waiting states (neither yes nor no)

- Artifact is good, timing is wrong
- Artifact is honest, motive is immature
- Artifact is strong, context is saturated

Waiting is a decision, not hesitation.

---

## Silence as an outcome

Not publishing is not:
failure
fear
missed opportunity

It is:
energy preservation
rhythm protection
field respect

---

## Non-negotiable principle

HCM does not explain itself to be accepted.
HCM does not appear to prove itself.

What deserves existence
will appear when permitted.

---

The Gate does not judge.
The Gate discerns.
